# Multi-Platform Messaging Service â€“ Security Architecture Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to design, document, and validate the **end-to-end security architecture** of a messaging platform that supports smartphones, tablets, desktops, and feature phones. The backend uses a **microservices architecture** with heterogeneous technology stacks, requiring robust security across all layers.

---

## Objectives

- Identify and define security requirements
- Perform STRIDE-based threat modelling
- Prescribe security controls across system layers
- Document the security architecture design
- Validate security controls through test cases and automated tools

---

## System Scope

### Clients
- Android and iOS mobile apps
- Desktop applications and web browsers
- Feature phone support (minimal interface)

### Backend
- Microservices-based architecture
- Authentication, Messaging, Media Storage, Notifications
- API Gateway, relational and NoSQL databases

### Communication
- TLS 1.3, WebSockets, REST APIs
- End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for messages

## Threat Modelling (STRIDE)

| Category        | Threats Addressed                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spoofing**    | Token theft, impersonation, fake clients              |
| **Tampering**   | Message or payload modification                       |
| **Repudiation** | Lack of traceability or audit logs                    |
| **Information Disclosure** | Data leakage, insecure storage, log exposure |
| **Denial of Service** | Flooding APIs, resource abuse                    |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Role escalation, admin bypass               |

## Security Controls

### Authentication & Access
- OAuth2 with PKCE
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Short-lived access tokens + refresh flows
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Data Protection
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- End-to-End message encryption
- Secure credential and secret management

### API & Microservice Security
- API Gateway rate limiting and validation
- Mutual TLS between internal services
- Input sanitization and validation
- Zero Trust Architecture principles

### Monitoring & Operations
- Centralized logging with redaction
- SIEM integration for anomaly detection
- Regular SAST/DAST and dependency scanning
- Alerting on privilege misuse and access patterns

## Security Testing

| Area           | Tools & Methods                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Auth/AuthZ     | Postman, manual role tampering tests      |
| API Security   | OWASP ZAP, fuzz testing, DAST             |
| Network        | SSL Labs, Wireshark, nmap                 |
| Infrastructure | Trivy, kube-bench, CIS-CAT                |
| Logging        | Manual review, regex scans for secrets    |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Secret scanning, dependency monitoring    |
